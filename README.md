## Problem Statement

This dashboard provides insights into the revenue earned by a pizza shop company in the year 2015. It enables the company to evaluate its overall revenue performance and identify key contributors, including best pizza category and thebest selling pizza size. The insights will help the company understand revenue trends and optimize marketing strategies to improve overall sales.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Load the dataset (a CSV file) containing sales and revenue information into Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2: Open Power Query Editor and enable "Column distribution," "Column quality," and "Column profile" under the View tab in the Data Preview section.
- Step 3: Profile columns based on the entire dataset instead of the default first 1000 rows.
- Step 4: Handle missing or erroneous data:

    Found no errors or empty values in most columns.
    Columns with null values (e.g., "Revenue" for certain entries) were reviewed and adjusted. Null values were excluded from calculations for accuracy.

- Step 5: Created a clean dataset by applying necessary transformations (e.g., removing nulls, creating calculated columns).
- Step 6: Designed the report to display company-level revenue insights:

    Added visuals such as donut charts, pie chart, bar charts, and cards to showcase the revenue trends across 2015.

    Used filters for selecting year.

- Step 7 : Created DAX measures for custom calculations.


- Step 8 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
